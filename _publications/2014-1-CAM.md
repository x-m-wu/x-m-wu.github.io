Calibration and identification of the exchange effect between the karst aquifers and the underlying conduit network is an important issue in order to gain a better understanding of these hydraulic systems. Based on a coupled continuum pipe flow model describing flows in karst aquifers, this paper is devoted to the identification of an exchange rate function, which models the hydraulic interaction between the fissured volume (matrix) and the conduit, from the Neumann boundary data, i.e. matrix/conduit seepage velocity. We formulate this parameter identification problem as a nonlinear operator equation and prove the  compactness of the forward mapping. The stable approximate solution is obtained by two classic iterative regularization methods, namely the Landweber iteration and Levenberg-Marquardt method. Numerical examples on noise-free and noisy data shed light on the appropriateness of the proposed approaches.
