The interior transmission problem (ITP) plays an important role in the investigation of the inverse scattering problem. In this paper we propose the finite element method for solving the ITP. Based on the \\(\mathbf{T}\\)-coercivity, we derive both priori error estimate and a posteriori error estimate of the finite element approximation. Numerical experiments are also included to illustrate the accuracy of the finite element method.
