The modified Maxwell's Stekloff eigenvalue problem arises recently from the inverse electromagnetic scattering theory for inhomogeneous media. This paper contains a rigorous analysis of both the eigenvalue problem and the associated source problem on Lipschitz polyhedra. A new finite element method is proposed to compute Stekloff eigenvalues. By applying the Babu\v{s}ka--Osborn theory, we prove an error estimate without additional regularity assumptions. Numerical results are presented for validation.
