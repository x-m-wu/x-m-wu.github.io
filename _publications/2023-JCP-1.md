In this paper, we propose a finite element method for solving the coupled model of classical
drift-diffusion equations and Schrödinger-Poisson equations in simulating a resonant tunneling
diode (RTD). The coupling coefficient Θ and the quantum electron density 𝑛qu are defined
by weighted integrals of |𝜓𝑝|2 where 𝜓𝑝 is the wave function of Schrödinger equation for
each momentum 𝑝 ∈ ℝ. We first prove a growth rate of |𝜓𝑝| as |𝑝| → +∞. This enables us to
truncate the momentum space ℝ to a bounded interval [−𝑃 , 𝑃 ], which corresponds to an energy
interval [0, 𝐸𝑃 ]. We propose an energy-adaptive algorithm based on a posteriori error estimate
for computing Θ and 𝑛qu approximately on [0, 𝐸𝑃 ]. The algorithm reduces the number of nodes
greatly by capturing resonance peaks accurately and adjusting the partition of [0, 𝐸𝑃 ] adaptively.
Numerical experiment for an RTD shows that, based on energy-adaptive grids, the Gummel
method for solving the coupled model is robust and can converge in several iterative steps.
