In this paper, we propose a finite element method for solving the coupled model of classical drift-diffusion equations and Schr\\(\"{o}\\)dinger-Poisson equations in simulating a resonant tunneling diode (RTD). The coupling coefficient \\(Theta\\) and the quantum electron density \\(n^{\rm qu}\\) are defined by weighted integrals of \\(\lvert{\psi_p}\rvert^2\\) where \\(\psi_p\\) is the wave function of Schr\\(\"{o}\\)dinger equation for each momentum \\(p\in\mathbb{R}\\). We first prove a growth rate of \\(\lvert{\psi_p}\rvert\\) as \\(\lvert p\rvert\to +\infty\\). This enables us to truncate the momentum space \\(\mathbb{R}\\) to a bounded interval \\([-P,P]\\), which corresponds to an energy interval \\([0,E_P]\\). We propose an energy-adaptive algorithm based on a posteriori error estimate for computing \\(\Theta\\) and \\(n^{\rm qu}\\) approximately on \\([0,E_P]\\). The algorithm reduces the number of nodes greatly by capturing resonance peaks accurately and adjusting the partition of \\([0,E_P]\\) adaptively. Numerical experiment for an RTD shows that, based on energy-adaptive grids, the Gummel method for solving the coupled model is robust and can converge in several iterative steps.
