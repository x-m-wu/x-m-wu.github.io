In this paper, we propose a splitting Fourier pseudospectral method for Vlasov–Poisson–Fokker–Planck (VPFP) system, which describes the motion of charged particles in plasma. The numerical integration for the system is performed by employing the splitting method in time, Fourier Galerkin method in space direction, and Fourier collocation method in phase direction, respectively. The algorithm has spectral accuracy in both space and phase directions and can be implemented efficiently with the fast Fourier transform and technique of diagonalization, respectively. Extensive numerical results in one-dimensional phase space (or \\(1x \times 1v\\)) from the proposed numerical method are shown and have proven the good agreement with the theory and previous studies. Numerical algorithm for the VPFP system in two-dimensional phase space (or \\(2x \times 2v\\)) has been summarized in Appendix.
